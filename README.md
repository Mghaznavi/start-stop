# EC2 Instances Management using AWS Lambda
This project is used to manage EC2 instances like start instance, stop instance, get the status of an instance and schedule which and when instances being started/stopped.
The start, stop, and status action will be done using SLACK Slash command and scheduled
action will be automatically follow the configuration file specified.
The system architecture can be found in */diagram* folder.

    ```https://YOUR_SLACK_TEAM.slack.com/apps/manage/custom-integrations```
    then save **incoming webhooks url** to be used later too.

### Configuration
- Setup **region**, **lambda arn**, and **accound_id** in **main.tf** file :

    ```
    variable "region" {
        default = "YOUR_REGION"
    }
    variable "account_id" {
        default = "YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID"
    }
    variable "lambda_role" {
        default = "Arn Role for lambda fit SNS and EC2 Full Acces"
    }
    ```

    make sure you entry a valid region listed below :

    | Region Code   | Region Name       |
    |:-------------:|:-------------:|
    | us-east-2     | US East (Ohio) |
    | us-east-1     |US East (N. Virginia)     |  
    | us-west-1     | US West (N. California)      |
    | us-west-2     | US West (Oregon)      |
    | ap-south-1    | Asia Pacific (Mumbai)      |
    |ap-northeast-2 | Asia Pacific (Seoul)      |
    |ap-southeast-1 | Asia Pacific (Singapore)      |
    |ap-southeast-2 | Asia Pacific (Sydney)      |
    |ap-northeast-1 | Asia Pacific (Tokyo)      |
    |ca-central-1   | Canada (Central)     |
    |eu-central-1   | EU (Frankfurt)     |
    |eu-west-1      | EU (Ireland)      |
    |eu-west-2      | EU (London)      |
    |sa-east-1      | South America (SÃ£o Paulo)      |

    and **don't forget to set your AWS Account ID**, you can get it from AWS Console, click **Setting** then **Support Center** in the upper left side of your AWS Console,and you will get the id in the upper left side too

- Setup **Terraform Remote Config BackEnd**
    ```
    terraform {
        backend "s3" {
            bucket = "YOUR_S3_BUCKET_NAME"
            key    = "terraform.tfstate"
            region = "us-west-2"
        }
    }

    data "terraform_remote_state" "network" {
        backend = "s3"
        config {
            bucket = "YOUR_S3_BUCKET_NAME"
            key    = "terraform.tfstate"
            region = "us-west-2"
       }
    }
    ```
    Specify your S3 bucket name to configure **terraform remote state backend**.

- Setup **slack_teams**, **instances**, and **scheduled_events**

    **slack_teams** is a configuration where you define your slack team (one or more) that will be connected to system and can manage ec2 instances.Here is some example of configuration :
    ```
    EXAMPLE_TEAM_A_ID :
        team_name:             EXAMPLE TEAM NAME A
        slash_command_token:   SLASH_COMMAND_TOKEN
        incoming_webhook_url:  |
        https://hooks.example-slack.com/services/FZVVpScFjkhjhdsjdhsjhdjsh
    ```

    Note that a slack team id from previous step used here as an index then we define its atributes such as team_name, slash_command_token, incoming_webhook_url. Please beware of indentation and multiline input when you edit or add a config.

    **instances** is section where you can define instance whitelist that can be started/stopped either by using slack or scheduled events, here is the example of configuration :
    ```
    instancename-01:
        id :                   i-EXAMPLE
        region :               us-west-2
        slack_team_id:         EXAMPLE
    ```
    instancename-01 is an instance name that you define associated with an ec2 instance so we can start by its name.Please make sure that instancesname is unique, region valid, and slack_team_id already registered before in previous configuration.
    **scheduled_events** is section where you define scheduled events to start/stop
    instance, here is the sample configuration :
    ```
    start-instances-group-a:
        scheduled_expression:  rate(10 minutes) (rate or cron expression)
        command:               start | stop
        state :                ENABLED | DISABLED
        instances:
            - a-01
            - a-02
            - a-03

    ```
    in scheduled_expression you can use ```rate()``` or valid ```CRON``` expression
## Deployment
To deploy the project, just run command below :

``` python deploy.py```

Then you will get URL ENDPOINT, then use it to finish your slash command setup
